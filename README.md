# Weather_Report
JS,PHP

Problem Statement:

Develop a web application that utilizes the Google Maps API and the OpenWeather API to provide users with real-time weather information based on either city names or geographical coordinates. The application should allow users to input a city name or click on the map to retrieve weather data for the selected location.

Objective:

The objective is to create a user-friendly interface where users can:

Input a city name to retrieve weather information for that city.
Click on the map to select a location and view its weather details.
Display weather data such as temperature, wind speed, cloudiness, and precipitation for the selected location.
Utilize the Google Maps API to provide a visual representation of the selected location.
Utilize the OpenWeather API to fetch real-time weather data based on user input.
Functionality:

Weather Retrieval:
Allow users to input a city name and fetch weather data for that city using the OpenWeather API.
Enable users to click on the map to select a location and retrieve weather information based on the selected coordinates.
Utilize XMLHttpRequest to send requests to the OpenWeather API and retrieve weather data in JSON format.
Display Weather Information:
Display weather details such as temperature, weather description, wind speed, cloudiness, and precipitation for the selected location.
Provide additional details like latitude, longitude, visibility, and the "feels like" temperature.
Present the weather information in a clear and structured format for easy understanding.
Map Integration:
Utilize the Google Maps API to display a map interface where users can click to select a location or view the weather information visually.
Implement functionality to place a marker on the map at the selected location and adjust the map view accordingly.
Error Handling:
Implement proper error handling for API requests to handle cases such as invalid input or failed requests.
Display informative messages to users in case of errors or unsuccessful requests.
Approach:

Utilize JavaScript to handle user interactions and make asynchronous requests to both the Google Maps API and the OpenWeather API.
Implement functions to handle weather data retrieval based on city names or geographical coordinates.
Display weather information dynamically on the webpage using HTML and CSS.
Integrate the Google Maps API to provide a visual representation of selected locations on the map.
Utilize PHP as a server-side proxy to handle API requests to the OpenWeather API securely.
Note:

Ensure proper API key management for both the Google Maps API and the OpenWeather API.
Design the user interface to be intuitive and responsive for a seamless user experience.
Example Scenario:

A user visits the web application and inputs "New York" in the city input field. The application fetches real-time weather data for New York City from the OpenWeather API and displays the information, including temperature, wind speed, cloudiness, and precipitation, along with a marker on the map indicating the location. The user can also click on the map to select a different location and view its weather details.
